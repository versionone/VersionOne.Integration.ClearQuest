Before using ClearQuest integration need to make some preparation:

   1. Create new status behaviour.
          * create states:
            defect waiting for submit to the VersionOne (WaitedV1 from config),
            defect submitted to the VersionOne (SubmittedToV1 from config)
          * create actions:
            make defect waiting for submit to the VersionOne
            defect was submitted to the VersionOne (SubmitToV1 from submit)
   2. Make some fields mandatory for "waiting for submit to the VersionOne" state:
          * Owner
          * Project
New behavour pattern:

Submitted state -> [WaitV1 action] -> WaitedV1 state -> [SubmittedToV1 action] -> SubmittedToV1 state -> [Close action] -> Closed state



Way for making this operations described in documentation for the ClearQuest.
