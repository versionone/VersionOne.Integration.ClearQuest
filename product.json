Leverage existing automated workflows and defect reporting, while adding the practice of agile project management. This integration creates defects in VersionOne based on defects in ClearQuest. Using this integration your organization can manage and triage defects reported by customers and promote them to VersionOne once you determine a fix is necessary. Once the integraion is installed and configured, ClearQuest users can assign defects to VersionOne and they appear as Defects in the VersionOne repository. When the VersionOne defect is closed, the integration updates the ClearQuest repository to relfect this change."

It is not recommended that poll intervals remain this low in a production instance. \n * Update: Source code project was dependent on .NET 3.5. Now source code project depends on the latest .NET SDK. \n * Updated: Integration depends on Log4Net \n * Updated: Poll time interval defaults to 30 minutes \n * Fixed: Configuration Utility allows editing of the VersionOne credential fields when Windows Integrated Authentication is enabled. This enables configuring the integrations to connect to VersionOne as a user other than the local service account when the VersionOne instance is configured for Windows integrated authentication.",
